    <h1>Kaziranga National Park</h1>
    <p>
      Kaziranga National Park is a national park in the Golaghat and Nagaon
      districts of the state of Assam, India. The park, which hosts two-thirds
      of the world's great one-horned rhinoceroses, is a World Heritage Site.[2]
      According to the census held in March 2018 which was jointly conducted by
      the Forest Department of the Government of Assam and some recognized
      wildlife NGOs, the rhino population in Kaziranga National Park is 2,613.
      It comprises 1,641 adult rhinos (642 males, 793 females, 206 unsexed); 387
      sub-adults (116 males, 149 females, 122 unsexed); and 385 calves.[3] In
      2015, the rhino population stood at 2401. Kaziranga National Park was
      declared a Tiger Reserve in 2006. The park is home to large breeding
      populations of elephants, wild water buffalo, and swamp deer.[4] Kaziranga
      is recognized as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International for
      conservation of avifaunal species. When compared with other protected
      areas in India, Kaziranga has achieved notable success in wildlife
      conservation. Located on the edge of the Eastern Himalaya biodiversity
      hotspot, the park combines high species diversity and visibility.
      Kaziranga is a vast expanse of tall elephant grass, marshland, and dense
      tropical moist broadleaf forests, criss-crossed by four major rivers,
      including the Brahmaputra, and the park includes numerous small bodies of
      water. Kaziranga has been the theme of several books, songs, and
      documentaries. The park celebrated its centennial in 2005 after its
      establishment in 1905 as a reserve forest. In 2017, Kaziranga came under
      severe criticism after a BBC News documentary revealed a hardliner
      strategy to conservation, reporting the killing of 20 people a year in the
      name of rhino conservation.[5] As a consequence of this reporting, BBC
      News was banned from filming in protected areas in India for 5 years.[6]
      While several news reports claimed that BBC had apologized for the
      documentary, the BBC stood by its report, with its Director General, Tony
      Hall, writing in a letter to Survival International that the letter "in no
      way constitutes an apology for our journalism."[7] As a response to the
      report, researchers in India have provided more nuanced understanding of
      the matter, calling out BBC for the carelessness of its journalism, but
      also pointing to the problems of conservation in Kaziranga[8] and
      questioning whether shoot-at-sight has been a useful conservation strategy
      at all.[9]
