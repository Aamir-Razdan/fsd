    <h1>Konark</h1>
    <p>
      Konark is a medium town in the Puri district in the state of Odisha,
      India. It lies on the coast by the Bay of Bengal, 65 kilometres from the
      capital of the state, Bhubaneswar.[1] It is the site of the 13th-century
      Sun Temple, also known as the Black Pagoda, built in black granite during
      the reign of Narasinghadeva-I. The temple is a World Heritage Site.[2] The
      temple is now mostly in ruins, and a collection of its sculptures is
      housed in the Sun Temple Museum, which is run by the Archaeological Survey
      of India. Konark is also home to an annual dance festival called Konark
      Dance Festival, devoted to classical Indian dance forms, including the
      traditional classical dance of Odisha, Odissi.[3] In February 2019, the
      Konark Dance Festival (now called Konark Music and Dance Festival) will be
      hosting its 33rd edition. The state government is also organising annual
      Konark Festival and International Sand Art Festival[4] at Chandrabhaga
      Beach of Konark. On 16 February 1980, Konark lay directly on the path of a
      total solar eclipse.[5][6][7] Etymology The name Konârka is derived from
      the Sanskrit word Kona (meaning angle) and word Arka (meaning sun) in
      reference to the temple which was dedicated to the Sun god Surya.[8] The
      Sun Temple Main article: Konark Sun Temple Konark Sun Temple The Sun
      Temple was built in the 13th century and designed as a gigantic chariot of
      the Sun God, Surya, with twelve pairs of ornamented wheels pulled by seven
      horses. Some of the wheels are 3 metres wide. Only six of the seven horse
      still stand today.[9] The temple fell into disuse after an envoy of
      Jahangir desecrated the temple in the early 17th century.[10] According to
      folklore, there was a diamond in the centre of the idol which reflected
      the sun rays that passed. In 1627, the then Raja of Khurda took the Sun
      idol from Konark to the Jagannath temple in Puri. The Sun temple belongs
      to the Kalingan school of Indian temple architecture. The alignment of the
      Sun Temple is along the east–west direction. The inner sanctum or vimana
      used to be surmounted by a tower or shikara but it was razed in the 19th
      century. The audience hall or jagamohana still stands and comprises
      majority of the ruins. The roof of the dance hall or natmandir has fallen
      off. It stands at the eastern end of the ruins on a raised platform.[11]
