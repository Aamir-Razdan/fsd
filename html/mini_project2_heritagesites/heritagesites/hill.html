    <h1>Hill Forts of Rajasthan</h1>
    <p>
      The North Western Indian State of Rajasthan has over one hundred
      fortifications on hills and mountainous terrain. Six Hill Forts of
      Rajasthan, spread across Rajasthan state in northern India, have been
      clustered as a series and designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. The ‘Hill
      Forts of Rajasthan’ was initially submitted to the UNESCO as a serial
      property formed by five Rajput forts in the Aravalli Range,[1] and were
      built and enhanced between the 5th and 18th centuries CE by several Rajput
      kings of different kingdoms. The UNESCO series has been increased to six
      forts. They consist of: Chittor Fort at Chittorgarh city Kumbhalgarh Fort
      at Rajsamand city Ranthambore Fort at Sawai Madhopur Gagron Fort at
      Jhalawar city Amer Fort at Jaipur city Jaisalmer Fort at Jaisalmer city
      Some of these forts have defensive fortification wall up to 20 km long,
      still surviving urban centers and still in use water harvesting
      mechanism.[2] Selection A series was to be selected as a UNESCO World
      Heritage Site to highlight the culture and architecture of hilltop Rajput
      forts. The State party of Rajasthan presented an overview of the process
      for the selection of component sites for the series of Hill Forts and the
      criteria selected. The criteria set resulting in the selection process
      followed the four following perimeters: The forts adapted to the Geography
      of the Hilltops, the fortifications were power centers, they included
      sacred grounds, and the fort was designed with urban settlements. Rajputs
      adhered to architectural texts that categorized different typologies of
      fortifications based on their geography. The earliest literary references
      differentiated four types of forts; Hilltop Forts, Water Forts, Forest
      Forts, and Desert Forts. This series of world heritage sites was created
      solely on the Hilltop Forts of Rajasthan. This and excluded many forts
      solely based on typology such as Junagarh Fort which is a ground fort.
      Furthermore forts that were not designed for urban settlement were
      excluded[citation needed]. Mehrangarh, although situated on a hilltop, was
      a fortified citadel for the court which lacked an urban settlement for the
      civilians. An initial list Forts of Rajasthan was created based on all
      forts recorded by the Archaeological Survey of India. Of the hundreds of
      fortifications, 54 forts were further examined as they shared integral
      characteristics of Rajput military architecture. The State party explained
      how from this initial listing, a smaller group was selected made of 24 of
      the most significant forts of Rajasthan which all shared key aspects of
      Rajput Fortifications. This number was soon shortlisted to 13. From this
      list five forts were initially selected, all of which were located on the
      Aravalli Range, and belonged to different clans. The sixth fort, Jaisalmer
      was later added into the series.
