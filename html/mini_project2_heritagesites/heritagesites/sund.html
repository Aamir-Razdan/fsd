    <h1>Sundarbans</h1>
    <p>
      Sundarbans (pronounced /sʌnˈdɑːrbənz/) is a mangrove area in the delta
      formed by the confluence of the Padma, Brahmaputra and Meghna Rivers in
      the Bay of Bengal. Sundarban Reserve Forest (SRF) of Bangladesh is the
      largest mangrove forest in the world. It spans the area from the Baleswar
      River in Bangladesh's division of Khulna to the Hooghly River in India's
      state of West Bengal. It comprises closed and open mangrove forests, land
      used for agricultural purpose, mudflats and barren land, and is
      intersected by multiple tidal streams and channels. Sundarbans is home to
      the world's largest area of mangrove forests.[3] Four protected areas in
      the Sundarbans are enlisted as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, viz.
      Sundarbans West (Bangladesh), Sundarbans South (Bangladesh), Sundarbans
      East (Bangladesh) and Sundarbans National Park (India).[4] Despite these
      protections, the Indian Sundarbans were considered endangered in a 2020
      assessment under the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems framework.[5] The
      Sundarbans mangrove forest covers an area of about 10,000 km2 (3,900 sq
      mi), of which forests in Bangladesh's Khulna Division extend over 6,517
      km2 (2,516 sq mi) and in West Bengal, they extend over 3,483 km2 (1,345 sq
      mi) across the South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas districts.[6] The
      most abundant tree species are sundri (Heritiera fomes) and gewa
      (Excoecaria agallocha). The forests provide habitat to 453 fauna wildlife,
      including 290 bird, 120 fish, 42 mammal, 35 reptile and eight amphibian
      species.[7] Despite a total ban on all killing or capture of wildlife
      other than fish and some invertebrates, it appears that there is a
      consistent pattern of depleted biodiversity or loss of species in the 20th
      century, and that the ecological quality of the forest is declining.[8]
      Despite preservation commitments from both governments, the Sundarbans are
      under threat from both natural and human-made causes. In 2007, the
      landfall of Cyclone Sidr damaged around 40% of the Sundarbans. The forest
      is also suffering from increased salinity due to rising sea levels due to
      climate change and reduced freshwater supply. In May 2009 Cyclone Aila
      devastated the Sundarbans with massive casualties. At least 100,000 people
      were affected by this cyclone.[9][10] The proposed coal-fired Rampal power
      station situated 14 km (8.7 mi) north of the Sundarbans at Rampal Upazila
      of Bagerhat District in Khulna, Bangladesh, is anticipated to further
      damage this unique mangrove forest according to a 2016 report by
      UNESCO.[11] Climate change is expected to both continue to negatively
      effect both natural systems and human populations in the region, resulting
      in further ecosystem degradation and climate migration. Experts examining
      the region recommend further focus on mangrove restoration and management
      and advocating for adaptation of human populations, through processes like
      managed retreat and investments in resilient infrastructure.
