    <h1>Khajuraho Group of Monuments</h1>
    <p>
      The Khajuraho Group of Monuments are a group of Hindu and Jain temples in
      Chhatarpur district, Madhya Pradesh, India. They are about 175 kilometers
      southeast of Jhansi, 10km from Azad Nagar Khajwa, 9km from Rajnagar and 49
      km from district headquarter Chhatarpur. They are a UNESCO World Heritage
      Site.[1][2] The temples are famous for their nagara-style architectural
      symbolism and a few erotic sculptures.[3] Most Khajuraho temples were
      built between 885 CE and 1000 CE by the Chandela dynasty.[4][5] Historical
      records note that the Khajuraho temple site had 85 temples by the 12th
      century, spread over 20 square kilometers. Of these, only about 25 temples
      have survived, spread over six square kilometers.[2] Of the surviving
      temples, the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple is decorated with a profusion of
      sculptures with intricate details, symbolism and expressiveness of ancient
      Indian art.[6] The temple complex was forgotten and overgrown by the
      jungle until 1838 when Captain T.S. Burt, a British engineer, visited the
      complex and reported his findings in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of
      Bengal.[7] When these monuments were built, the boys in the place lived in
      hermitages, by being brahmcharis (bachelor) until they attained manhood
      and these sculptures helped them to learn about the worldly role of
      'householder'.[8] The Khajuraho group of temples were built together but
      were dedicated to two religions, Hinduism and Jainism, suggesting a
      tradition of acceptance and respect for diverse religious views among
      Hindus and Jains in the region.[9]
