    <h1>Elephanta Caves</h1>
    <p>
      The Elephanta Caves are a collection of cave temples predominantly
      dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva.[1][2][3] They are on Elephanta Island,
      or Gharapuri (literally "the city of caves"),[4] in Mumbai Harbour, 10
      kilometres (6.2 mi) east of Mumbai in the Indian state of Mahārāshtra. The
      island, about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) west of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port,
      consists of five Hindu caves, a few Buddhist stupa mounds that date back
      to the 2nd century BCE,[5][2][6] and two Buddhist caves with water
      tanks.[7][8] The Elephanta Caves contain rock cut stone sculptures, mostly
      in high relief, that show syncretism of Hindu and Buddhist ideas and
      iconography.[6][9][10] The caves are hewn from solid basalt rock. Except
      for a few exceptions, much of the artwork is defaced and damaged.[11] The
      main temple's orientation as well as the relative location of other
      temples are placed in a mandala pattern.[2] The carvings narrate Hindu
      mythologies, with the large monolithic 5.45 metres (17.9 ft) Trimurti
      Sadashiva (three-faced Shiva), Nataraja (Lord of dance) and Yogishvara
      (Lord of Yoga) being the most celebrated.[2][12][13] These date to between
      the 5th and 9th centuries, and scholars attribute them to various Hindu
      dynasties.[1][2] They are most commonly placed between the 5th and 7th
      centuries. Many scholars consider them to have been completed by about 550
      CE.[3][14][15] They were named Elefante – which morphed to Elephanta – by
      the colonial Portuguese who found elephant statues on the caves. They
      established a base on the island. The main cave (Cave 1, or the Great
      Cave) was a Hindu place of worship until the Portuguese arrived, whereupon
      the island ceased to be an active place of worship.[2] The earliest
      attempts to prevent further damage to the caves were started by British
      India officials in 1909.[16] The monuments were restored in the 1970s.[2]
      In 1987, the restored Elephanta Caves were designated a UNESCO World
      Heritage Site. It is currently maintained by the Archaeological Survey of
      India
