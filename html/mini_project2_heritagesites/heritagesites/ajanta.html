    <h1>AJANTA CAVES</h1>
    <p>
      The Ajanta Caves are approximately thirty rock-cut Buddhist cave monuments
      dating from the second century BCE to about 480 CE in the Aurangabad
      district of Maharashtra state in India.[1][note 1] The caves include
      paintings and rock-cut sculptures described as among the finest surviving
      examples of ancient Indian art, particularly expressive paintings that
      present emotions through gesture, pose and form.[3][4][5] They are
      universally regarded as masterpieces of Buddhist religious art. The caves
      were built in two phases, the first starting around the second century BCE
      and the second occurring from 400 to 650 CE, according to older accounts,
      or in a brief period of 460â€“480 CE according to later scholarship.[6] The
      site is a protected monument in the care of the Archaeological Survey of
      India,[7] and since 1983, the Ajanta Caves have been a UNESCO World
      Heritage Site. The Ajanta Caves constitute ancient monasteries (Chaityas)
      and worship-halls (Viharas) of different Buddhist traditions carved into a
      75-metre (246 ft) wall of rock.[8][9] The caves also present paintings
      depicting the past lives [10] and rebirths of the Buddha, pictorial tales
      from Aryasura's Jatakamala, and rock-cut sculptures of Buddhist
      deities.[8][11][12] Textual records suggest that these caves served as a
      monsoon retreat for monks, as well as a resting site for merchants and
      pilgrims in ancient India.[8] While vivid colours and mural wall painting
      were abundant in Indian history as evidenced by historical records, Caves
      16, 17, 1 and 2 of Ajanta form the largest corpus of surviving ancient
      Indian wall-painting.[13] Panoramic view of Ajanta Caves from the nearby
      hill The Ajanta Caves are mentioned in the memoirs of several medieval-era
      Chinese Buddhist travellers.[14] They were covered by jungle until
      accidentally "discovered" and brought to Western attention in 1819 by a
      colonial British officer Captain John Smith on a tiger-hunting party.[15]
      The caves are in the rocky northern wall of the U-shaped gorge of the
      river Waghur,[16] in the Deccan plateau.[17][18] Within the gorge are a
      number of waterfalls, audible from outside the caves when the river is
      high.[19] With the Ellora Caves, Ajanta is one of the major tourist
      attractions of Maharashtra. It is about 59 kilometres (37 miles) from the
      city of Jalgaon, Maharashtra, India, 104 kilometres (65 miles) from the
      city of Sambhajinagar, and 350 kilometres (220 miles) east-northeast of
      Mumbai.[8][20] Ajanta is 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the Ellora Caves,
      which contain Hindu, Jain and Buddhist caves, the last dating from a
      period similar to Ajanta. The Ajanta style is also found in the Ellora
      Caves and other sites such as the Elephanta Caves, Aurangabad Caves,
      Shivleni Caves and the cave temples of Karnataka.
