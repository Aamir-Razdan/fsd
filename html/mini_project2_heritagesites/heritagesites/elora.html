    <h1>Ellora Caves</h1>
    <p>
      Ellora is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Aurangabad district
      of Maharashtra, India. It is one of the largest rock-cut Hindu temple cave
      complexes in the world, with artwork dating from the period 600–1000
      CE.[1][2] Cave 16 features the largest single monolithic rock excavation
      in the world, the Kailash temple, a chariot-shaped monument dedicated to
      the god Shiva. The Kailash temple excavation also features sculptures
      depicting various Hindu deities as well as relief panels summarizing the
      two major Hindu epics. There are over 100 caves at the site, all excavated
      from the basalt cliffs in the Charanandri Hills, 34 of which are open to
      public.[3] These consist of 17 Hindu (caves 13–29), 12 Buddhist (caves
      1–12) and 5 Jain (caves 30–34) caves,[4][5] each group representing
      deities and mythologies prevalent in the 1st millennium CE, as well as
      monasteries of each respective religion.[4] They were built close to one
      another and illustrate the religious harmony that existed in ancient
      India.[2][6] All of the Ellora monuments were built during the Rashtrakuta
      dynasty (r. 753-982 CE), which constructed part of the Hindu and Buddhist
      caves, and the Yadava dynasty (c. 1187–1317), which constructed a number
      of the Jain caves. Funding for the construction of the monuments was
      provided by royals, traders and the wealthy of the region.[3][7] Although
      the caves served as temples and a rest stop for pilgrims,[5] the site's
      location on an ancient South Asian trade route also made it an important
      commercial centre in the Deccan region.[8] It is 29 kilometres (18 miles)
      north-west of Aurangabad, and about 300 kilometres (190 miles)
      east-northeast of Mumbai. Today, the Ellora Caves, along with the nearby
      Ajanta Caves, are a major tourist attraction in the Marathwada region of
      Maharashtra and a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of
      India (ASI).[9] Etymology Ellora, also called Verul or Elura, is the short
      form of the ancient name Elloorpuram.[10] The older form of the name has
      been found in ancient references such as the Baroda inscription of 812 CE
      which mentions "the greatness of this edifice" and that "this great
      edifice was built on a hill by Krishnaraja at Elapura, the edifice in the
      inscription being the Kailasa temple.[3] In the Indian tradition, each
      cave is named and has a suffix Guha (Sanskrit), Lena or Leni (Marathi),
      meaning cave.[3][11] It is also thought to be derived from Ilvalapuram,
      named after the asura Ilvala who ruled this region who was vanquished by
      Sage Agastya.[12]
