    <h1>Valley of Flowers</h1>
    <p>
      Valley of Flowers National Park is an Indian national park which was
      established in 1982. It is located in Chamoli in the state of Uttarakhand
      and is known for its meadows of endemic alpine flowers and the variety of
      flora. This richly diverse area is also home to rare and endangered
      animals, including the Asiatic black bear,[1] snow leopard,[1] musk
      deer,[1] brown bear, red fox[1] and blue sheep. Birds found in the park
      include Himalayan monal pheasant and other high altitude birds.[2] At 3352
      to 3658 meters above sea level, the gentle landscape of the Valley of
      Flowers National Park complements the rugged mountain wilderness of Nanda
      Devi National Park to the east.[3] Together, they encompass a unique
      transition zone between the mountain ranges of the Zanskar and Great
      Himalaya. The park stretches over an expanse of 87.50 km2 and it is about
      8 km long and 2 km wide.[2] The park lies completely in the temperate
      alpine zone. Both parks are encompassed in the Nanda Devi Biosphere
      Reserve (223,674 ha) which is further surrounded by a buffer zone
      (5,148.57 km2).[4] Nanda Devi National Park Reserve is in the UNESCO World
      Network of Biosphere Reserves. The park is open only during summer from
      June to October and it is covered by heavy snow for the rest of the
      year.[1] History Joan Margaret Legge's memorial grave. Documented
      explorers The place was little known to the outside world due to its
      inaccessibility. In 1931, Frank S. Smythe, Eric Shipton and R. L.
      Holdsworth, all British mountaineers, lost their way while returning from
      a successful expedition to Mt.Kamet and happened upon the valley, which
      was full of flowers. They were attracted to the beauty of the area and
      named it the "Valley of Flowers." Frank Smythe later authored a book of
      the same name.[5] In 1939, Joan Margaret Legge, (21 February 1885 – 4 July
      1939) a botanist deputed by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew,[2] arrived at
      the valley to study flowers and while traversing some rocky slopes to
      collect flowers, she slipped off and died.[6] Her sister later visited the
      valley and erected a memorial near the spot.[3] Prof. Chandra Prakash
      Kala, a botanist deputed by the Wildlife Institute of India, carried out a
      research study on the floristics and conservation of the valley for a
      decade, beginning in 1993.[7] He made an inventory of 520 alpine plants
      exclusively growing in this national park and authored two important books
      – "The Valley of Flowers – Myth and Reality" and "Ecology and Conservation
      of the Valley of Flowers National Park, Garhwal Himalaya.
