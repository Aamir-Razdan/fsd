    <h1>TAJ MAHAL</h1>
    <p>
      The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/; lit. 'Crown of the
      Palace')[4][5][6] is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right
      bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned
      in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb
      of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan
      himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex,
      which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens
      bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. Construction of the
      mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other
      phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is
      believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost
      estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be
      approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion). The construction project
      employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects
      led by Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, the emperor’s court architect. Various types
      of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and
      divinity. The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in
      1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the
      universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded
      by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's
      rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts more than 6 million visitors a
      year[3] and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the
      World (2000–2007) initiative.
